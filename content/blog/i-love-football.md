As a child, if you would ask me the one thing I enjoyed the most, it would be playing everyday right after school for 3 hours, uninterrupted carefree fun.  Over the years, as my family moved cities, and eventually I ended up moving to different countries, a part of me always longed for the same. 

Living in India, teenage years were the first time I realised how as girls we are almost deprived of this pure joy. I would often see my neighbours with their cricket bats going off to the ground. I wanted to play too, some game, any game but there was barely any opportunity to. I did get opportunities to compete in athletics during college, and they were surely the most memorable times of my college , but what I was truly looking for was to play and not necessarily compete, and that's when I found, football.

Let me be honest, I am not a good player ( by any means ), in fact at times, a bad player but I will always continue playing and put my best foot forward, because it is FUN! From Chennai, Edinburgh, Dubai and now finally Abu Dhabi, football has somehow been a consistent part of my life. And as now I have found a group where I have been enjoying the most, I can safely say that, playing sports really does have a huge impact on an individual's life. The camaraderie, the fun, the sports-woman spirit is something everyone, man/woman deserve to have in their life. So my first blog post is dedicated to the little girl in me, I hope I am able to do a little of what I have received for women in sports ( more on that for some other time )
