Living in **Abu Dhabi** with ðŸ’•

I write about ... well I am figuring out life, so mostly about my everyday life and some of my publicly post-able goals for 2025.  Since I am in my corporate girlie era, by the end of February 2025, I will share a monthly score card for my goals. ( corporate girlie era )

**2025 Goals** 

* Personal : Play football at least 52 times this year. 
* Health : Since copying from husband is not considered copying, let me copy his goal, be the fittest version of myself on my 30th birthday.
* Health : Walk 1,825,0000 steps this year with my husband. ( that's only 5,000 a day )
* Personal : Improve my texting game. ( which is almost non-existent ) ; aim is to not piss off my loved ones.
* Career : Finish CMA Part 2
* Wealth : Earn USD 500 from a side hustle.
