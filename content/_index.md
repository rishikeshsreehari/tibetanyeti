I write about ... well I am figuring out life, so mostly about my everyday life and some of my publicly post-able goals for 2025.  Since I am in my corporate girlie era, by the end of February 2025, I will share a monthly score card for my goals. ( corporate girlie era )

**2025 Goals** 

* Personal : Play football at least 52 times this year. ( 6/52* )
* Health : Since copying from husband is not considered copying, let me copy his goal, be the fittest version of myself on my 30th birthday. ( As of 20/02/2025 :No where towards the goal* )
* Health : Walk 1,825,000 steps this year with my husband. ( that's only 5,000 a day ) ( 69,813/ 1,825,000*)
* Personal : Improve my texting game. ( which is almost non-existent ) ; aim is to not piss off my loved ones. ( This I cannot answer :) *)
* Career : Finish CMA Part 2  ( No where towards the goal* )
* Wealth : Earn USD 500 from a side hustle.(0/500*)

`*As of 20/02/2025`
