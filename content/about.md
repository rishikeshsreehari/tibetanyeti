# About Yeti 🐾  

Hi, I’m **Yeti**—a vegetarian finance enthusiast with a penchant for movies, spreadsheets, and savory delights. I’m equal parts mythical and real, balancing my love for dal chawal with dreams of empowering women through sports.

## ❄ Who is Yeti?  
I’m not your average mountain dweller! This Yeti trades snowy peaks for financial models, chai breaks, and football pitches. When I’m not working, I’m indulging in life’s simple joys: flavorful momos, binge-worthy movies, and endless conversations about why gobi manchurian is a universal treasure.

## 🌱 What Fuels Yeti?  
- **North Indian Food**: Dal chawal, rajma chawal, parathas—they’re my comfort zone.  
- **Street Eats**: Steaming plates of momos and tangy gobi manchurian.  
- **South Indian Faves**: Crisp dosas, fluffy idlis, and coconut chutney perfection.  
- **Nepalese Essentials**: Wai Wai noodles—a forever favorite snack.

## 🎥 Movie Buff  
My heart belongs to two worlds:  
- **Bollywood Magic**: Shah Rukh Khan is king, and movies like *DDLJ* and *Swades* are my go-to comfort films.  
- **Kollywood Greats**: From the emotional brilliance of *96* to the action-packed fun of *Enthiran*.

## ⚽ Advocating for Women in Sports  
Football isn’t just a game—it’s a platform for empowerment. I’m passionate about seeing more women on the field, breaking stereotypes, and redefining possibilities in sports.

## 🏦 Finance Is My Jam  
Numbers make sense when nothing else does. Whether it’s managing portfolios or simplifying money matters, I love making finance approachable and exciting.  

---

## ✨ When I’m Not Working…  
You’ll find me:  
- Perfecting the art of dipping momos in spicy chutney 🥟  
- Rewatching *DDLJ* for the 87th time 🎬  
- Dreaming of a dosa that’s bigger than my plate 🥞  
- Strategizing for women’s football ⚽
